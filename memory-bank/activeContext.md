# Active Context: Current Work on CollabCanvas

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 2 - Advanced Features 🚀
**Branch:** `feature/ui-polish`
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**MVP Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Tests:** 113/113 Passing (100%) ✅

### MVP Achievement
- ✅ **MVP Complete** - All core collaborative features working
- ✅ **Infrastructure Proven** - Real-time sync, multiplayer presence, canvas isolation
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Deployed and tested with multiple users

### Phase 2 Ready
Now building advanced features beyond MVP - **no timeline constraints**, focusing on quality and feature completeness.

## Recent Changes (PR #7)

### Completed Features
1. **Real-time Cursor Tracking**
   - Cursors rendered as HTML overlay (not Konva) for independent scaling
   - Viewport coordinates with smooth positioning
   - 60fps throttling (16.6ms) for optimal performance
   - Unique colors per user (owner=black, collaborators=vibrant palette)

2. **Online Users List**
   - Shows users currently viewing specific canvas
   - Located top-right corner with animated green dot
   - Color-coded with cursor colors
   - "(you)" label for current user

3. **Presence Service**
   - `presence.service.ts` with CRUD operations
   - Structure: `/presence/{canvasId}/users/{userId}`
   - Automatic cleanup on disconnect (beforeunload, visibilitychange)
   - Isolated per canvas (no cross-contamination)

4. **usePresence Hook**
   - Manages cursor updates with throttling
   - Subscribes to presence for current canvas
   - Sets user online/offline on mount/unmount
   - Handles visibility changes and navigation

5. **Cursor Component**
   - SVG cursor icon with name label
   - HTML overlay for zoom independence
   - Smooth transitions with CSS
   - Color customization per user

### Key Technical Achievements
- Sub-50ms cursor latency (target: <50ms) ✅
- Throttled to 60fps to reduce Firebase writes
- Presence isolation verified (canvas A ≠ canvas B)
- Clean disconnect handling (no ghost cursors)

## Current Focus: Infrastructure + Canvas Deletion

### Priority 1: Infrastructure Improvements
User wants to ensure core infrastructure is solid:
1. **Real-time synchronization** - Maintain low latency (<100ms objects, <50ms cursors)
2. **Conflict resolution** - Better handling when multiple users edit simultaneously
3. **State management** - Consider migrating to Zustand for better undo/redo support
4. **Persistence & reconnection** - Ensure state survives refresh and network drops

### Priority 2: Canvas Deletion Feature
First new feature to implement after MVP:
- Soft delete (move to trash)
- Restore from trash
- Permanent deletion
- Trash view in dashboard

### Detailed Plans Created
- 📋 `infrastructure-analysis.md` - Complete analysis of current sync, conflict resolution, state management
- 📋 `feature-canvas-deletion.md` - Detailed implementation plan for deletion feature

## Next Immediate Steps

### Suggested Implementation Order

**Option A: Infrastructure First (Recommended)**
1. Add connection status indicator (quick win)
2. Implement canvas deletion (user request)
3. Add viewport persistence (quality of life)
4. Improve error handling (better UX)
5. Add version tracking + conflict detection
6. Migrate to Zustand for state management
7. Build undo/redo system

**Option B: Features First**
1. Canvas deletion (user request)
2. Quick infrastructure wins (connection status, viewport persistence)
3. Continue with new features
4. Circle major infrastructure work later

**User's Choice:** Start with canvas deletion, but ensure infrastructure is solid

### Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Conflict Resolution:** 
   - Option A: Version tracking + manual resolution (Recommended)
   - Option B: Full Operational Transformation (complex)
   - Option C: Keep Last-Write-Wins (current, lossy)

2. **State Management:**
   - Option A: Zustand (lightweight, recommended)
   - Option B: Redux Toolkit (more structure)
   - Option C: Keep component state (current, limits undo/redo)

3. **Canvas Deletion:**
   - Soft delete with trash (Recommended)
   - Hard delete with confirmation (risky)

## Active Technical Considerations

### Performance Goals (Must Verify)
- ✅ 60 FPS during pan/zoom/drag
- ⏳ 500+ shapes without FPS drops (needs verification in PR #9)
- ✅ Sub-100ms object sync latency
- ✅ Sub-50ms cursor sync latency (16.6ms achieved)
- ⏳ 5+ concurrent users per canvas (needs testing)

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Grid Performance** - Currently optimized with single draw call; need to verify at scale
2. **Loading States** - Need to add spinners for dashboard and canvas loading
3. **Error Handling** - Basic console.error; need user-facing error messages
4. **Security Rules** - Firestore in test mode; must deploy production rules
5. **Mobile Support** - Out of scope for MVP, but should handle gracefully

### Recent Architectural Decisions

#### Decision: HTML Overlay for Cursors (Not Konva)
**Rationale:** Cursors need to stay fixed size regardless of canvas zoom
**Implementation:** Absolute positioned divs with viewport coordinates
**Benefit:** Cursors remain readable at all zoom levels

#### Decision: 60fps Throttling for Cursor Updates
**Rationale:** Balance between smoothness and Firebase write limits
**Implementation:** Throttle in `usePresence.ts` with 16.6ms (60fps)
**Benefit:** Smooth cursor movement, reduced database writes

#### Decision: Presence Cleanup on Multiple Events
**Rationale:** Ensure users go offline reliably
**Implementation:** `beforeunload`, `visibilitychange`, and React cleanup
**Benefit:** No ghost cursors, clean presence tracking

## Code Areas to Focus On

### Files Needing Attention (PR #9)
1. **Canvas.tsx** - Add loading state, error boundary
2. **Dashboard.tsx** - Add loading spinner while fetching canvases
3. **GridDots.tsx** - Verify performance at high zoom levels
4. **Shape.tsx** - Ensure memoization is working
5. **useRealtimeSync.ts** - Add error handling for failed writes

### Testing Gaps to Fill
- Integration test for multiplayer presence (currently manual only)
- Performance benchmark tests (500+ shapes)
- Network resilience tests (reconnection)
- Multi-user stress test (5+ concurrent users)

## Environment & Configuration

### Current Setup
- **Dev Server:** `localhost:5173`
- **Firebase Project:** Configured (credentials in `.env`)
- **Git Branch:** `feature/ui-polish`

## Collaboration Context

### Multi-Canvas Architecture (Core Feature)
- Each canvas is isolated workspace
- Shareable via `/canvas/:canvasId` URL
- Dashboard shows all accessible canvases
- Real-time sync scoped per canvas
- Presence scoped per canvas

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)

- Decide on custom domain or use Vercel default
- Review Firebase security rules before production
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### For Performance (PR #9)
- What is acceptable loading time for dashboard with 20+ canvases?
- Should we add pagination to dashboard or is "load all" acceptable?
- What error recovery UX is best (reload button vs auto-retry)?
- Should we add analytics/monitoring for MVP?

### For Final Testing (PR #11)
- How many concurrent users should we target for stress testing?
- What browsers should we test on for final validation?
- Should we test on different network conditions (slow 3G, etc.)?
