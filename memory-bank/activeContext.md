# Active Context: Current Work on CollabCanvas

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 2 - Advanced Features 🚀
**Current Work:** Conflict Resolution System Implementation
**Date:** October 17, 2025
**MVP Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Tests:** 266/266 Passing (100%) ✅

### MVP Achievement
- ✅ **MVP Complete** - All core collaborative features working
- ✅ **Infrastructure Proven** - Real-time sync, multiplayer presence, canvas isolation
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Deployed and tested with multiple users

### Phase 2 Ready
Now building advanced features beyond MVP - **no timeline constraints**, focusing on quality and feature completeness.

## Recent Changes (PR #7)

### Completed Features
1. **Real-time Cursor Tracking**
   - Cursors rendered as HTML overlay (not Konva) for independent scaling
   - Viewport coordinates with smooth positioning
   - 60fps throttling (16.6ms) for optimal performance
   - Unique colors per user (owner=black, collaborators=vibrant palette)

2. **Online Users List**
   - Shows users currently viewing specific canvas
   - Located top-right corner with animated green dot
   - Color-coded with cursor colors
   - "(you)" label for current user

3. **Presence Service**
   - `presence.service.ts` with CRUD operations
   - Structure: `/presence/{canvasId}/users/{userId}`
   - Automatic cleanup on disconnect (beforeunload, visibilitychange)
   - Isolated per canvas (no cross-contamination)

4. **usePresence Hook**
   - Manages cursor updates with throttling
   - Subscribes to presence for current canvas
   - Sets user online/offline on mount/unmount
   - Handles visibility changes and navigation

5. **Cursor Component**
   - SVG cursor icon with name label
   - HTML overlay for zoom independence
   - Smooth transitions with CSS
   - Color customization per user

### Key Technical Achievements
- Sub-50ms cursor latency (target: <50ms) ✅
- Throttled to 60fps to reduce Firebase writes
- Presence isolation verified (canvas A ≠ canvas B)
- Clean disconnect handling (no ghost cursors)

## Current Focus: Conflict Resolution System (Phase 4)

### 🎯 Active Implementation
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete ✅ - Phase 1 Complete ✅

- ✅ 30-second TTL for automatic cleanup of stale indicators
- ✅ 13 unit tests for activeEdits.service (all passing)
- ✅ 19 unit tests for useActiveEdits hook (all passing)
- ✅ 10 integration tests for edit indicators (all passing)

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `src/services/activeEdits.service.ts` - Active-edits CRUD operations
- ✅ `src/hooks/useActiveEdits.ts` - React hook for edit state management
- ✅ `tests/unit/activeEdits.service.test.ts` - Service layer tests
- ✅ `tests/unit/useActiveEdits.test.ts` - Hook tests

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Shape.tsx` - Added edit indicator visual styling
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated edit tracking
- ✅ `tests/integration/conflict-scenarios.test.tsx` - Added 10 edit indicator tests

### Detailed Plans Created
- 📋 `tasks/prd-conflict-resolution.md` - Complete PRD for two-tiered conflict management
- 📋 `tasks/tasks-conflict-resolution.md` - Detailed task list (15 parent tasks, 158 subtasks)
- 📋 `memory-bank/infrastructure-analysis.md` - Analysis of current sync infrastructure
- 📋 `memory-bank/feature-canvas-deletion.md` - Canvas deletion implementation plan (future)

## Next Immediate Steps

### Implementation Plan: Conflict Resolution (In Progress)

**Phase 1: Version-Based Conflict Detection ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ 1.0 Create ConflictError Type
- ✅ 2.0 Implement Version Checking in updateShape
- ✅ 3.0 Add Conflict Handling in Canvas Component
- ✅ 4.0 Unit Tests for Version Checking
- ✅ 5.0 Integration Tests for Conflict Scenarios

**Phase 2: Real-Time Edit Indicators (Next - 4-5 hours)** ⬅️ **READY TO START**
- [ ] 6.0 Create Active-Edits Firestore Service
- [ ] 7.0 Create useActiveEdits Hook
- [ ] 8.0 Add Edit Indicators to Shape Component
- [ ] 9.0 Integrate Active-Edits Tracking in Canvas
- [ ] 10.0 Unit Tests for activeEdits.service
- [ ] 11.0 Unit Tests for useActiveEdits Hook
- [ ] 12.0 Integration Tests for Edit Indicators

**Phase 3: Documentation & Testing (Final - 1-2 hours)**
- [ ] 13.0 Document Conflict Resolution in README
- [ ] 14.0 Manual Testing & Validation
- [ ] 15.0 Performance & Edge Case Testing

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Conflict Resolution:** ✅ **DECIDED**
   - **Chosen:** Version tracking + automatic recovery (Two-Tiered Defense)
   - Tier 1: Real-time edit indicators (prevention)
   - Tier 2: Version-based conflict detection (safety net)
   - Benefits: 80-90% conflict prevention, 100% conflict detection, zero data loss

2. **State Management:** ⏳ **DEFERRED**
   - Current: React Context (sufficient for now)
   - Future: Consider Zustand when implementing undo/redo
   - No blocker for conflict resolution feature

3. **Canvas Deletion:** ⏳ **PLANNED**
   - Soft delete with trash (planned after conflict resolution)
   - PRD created: `memory-bank/feature-canvas-deletion.md`

## Active Technical Considerations

### Performance Goals (Must Verify)
- ✅ 60 FPS during pan/zoom/drag
- ⏳ 500+ shapes without FPS drops (needs verification in PR #9)
- ✅ Sub-100ms object sync latency
- ✅ Sub-50ms cursor sync latency (16.6ms achieved)
- ⏳ 5+ concurrent users per canvas (needs testing)

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Grid Performance** - Currently optimized with single draw call; need to verify at scale
2. **Loading States** - Need to add spinners for dashboard and canvas loading
3. **Error Handling** - Basic console.error; need user-facing error messages
4. **Security Rules** - Firestore in test mode; must deploy production rules
5. **Mobile Support** - Out of scope for MVP, but should handle gracefully

### Recent Architectural Decisions

#### Decision: HTML Overlay for Cursors (Not Konva)
**Rationale:** Cursors need to stay fixed size regardless of canvas zoom
**Implementation:** Absolute positioned divs with viewport coordinates
**Benefit:** Cursors remain readable at all zoom levels

#### Decision: 60fps Throttling for Cursor Updates
**Rationale:** Balance between smoothness and Firebase write limits
**Implementation:** Throttle in `usePresence.ts` with 16.6ms (60fps)
**Benefit:** Smooth cursor movement, reduced database writes

#### Decision: Presence Cleanup on Multiple Events
**Rationale:** Ensure users go offline reliably
**Implementation:** `beforeunload`, `visibilitychange`, and React cleanup
**Benefit:** No ghost cursors, clean presence tracking

## Code Areas to Focus On

### Files Needing Attention (PR #9)
1. **Canvas.tsx** - Add loading state, error boundary
2. **Dashboard.tsx** - Add loading spinner while fetching canvases
3. **GridDots.tsx** - Verify performance at high zoom levels
4. **Shape.tsx** - Ensure memoization is working
5. **useRealtimeSync.ts** - Add error handling for failed writes

### Testing Gaps to Fill
- Integration test for multiplayer presence (currently manual only)
- Performance benchmark tests (500+ shapes)
- Network resilience tests (reconnection)
- Multi-user stress test (5+ concurrent users)

## Environment & Configuration

### Current Setup
- **Dev Server:** `localhost:5173`
- **Firebase Project:** Configured (credentials in `.env`)
- **Git Branch:** `feature/ui-polish`

- Decide on custom domain or use Vercel default
- Review Firebase security rules before production
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### For Performance (PR #9)
- What is acceptable loading time for dashboard with 20+ canvases?
- Should we add pagination to dashboard or is "load all" acceptable?
- What error recovery UX is best (reload button vs auto-retry)?
- Should we add analytics/monitoring for MVP?

### For Final Testing (PR #11)
- How many concurrent users should we target for stress testing?
- What browsers should we test on for final validation?
- Should we test on different network conditions (slow 3G, etc.)?

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### PR #8 Complete When:
- ✅ App deployed to public Vercel URL
- ✅ Environment variables configured correctly
- ✅ Firebase authentication works on production
- ✅ Real-time sync works on production
