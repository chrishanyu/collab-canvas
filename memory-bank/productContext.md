# Product Context: CollabCanvas MVP

## Why This Project Exists

CollabCanvas is being built to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time collaborative design tools with a focus on proving the infrastructure before adding advanced features.

### Problems Being Solved

1. **Real-time Collaboration Complexity**
   - Challenge: Multiple users editing the same workspace simultaneously
   - Solution: Firebase real-time sync with last-write-wins conflict resolution
   - Result: Sub-100ms sync latency, isolated per-canvas workspaces

2. **Multi-Project Management**
   - Challenge: Users need to organize multiple design projects
   - Solution: Dashboard with unlimited canvas creation and sharing
   - Result: Clean project organization, shareable links for collaboration

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Challenge: Canvas performance degrades with many objects
   - Solution: Optimized rendering, viewport culling, memoization
   - Result: 60 FPS with 500+ shapes, optimized grid with single draw call

4. **Multiplayer Presence**
   - Challenge: Users need to know who else is working and where
   - Solution: Real-time cursor tracking, online user list, unique colors
   - Result: Sub-50ms cursor latency, clear visual presence indicators

## User Personas

### Canvas Owner (Primary)
**Goals:**
- Create new canvases for different projects
- Share canvases with collaborators via link
- See all their canvases organized in dashboard
- Know who's currently working on each canvas

**Pain Points:**
- Need fast, frictionless project creation
- Want clear visibility of canvas metadata (name, dates, owner)
- Need reliable sharing mechanism

### Canvas Collaborator (Secondary)
**Goals:**
- Join canvases via shared link
- Create and manipulate shapes
- See what other team members are doing in real-time
- Navigate large design spaces smoothly

**Pain Points:**
- Need instant visual feedback on changes
- Want to avoid conflicts when editing simultaneously
- Need smooth performance even with many objects

## How It Should Work

### New User Flow
1. Visit app → See landing/auth page
2. Register with email/password + display name
3. Login → Redirect to dashboard
4. Dashboard shows empty state with "Create New Canvas" button
5. Click create → Enter canvas name → New canvas opens
6. Start designing with toolbar tools

### Collaboration Flow
1. Canvas owner clicks "Share" button
2. Copy shareable link (`/canvas/:canvasId`)
3. Send link to collaborator
4. Collaborator clicks link → Redirected to login (if not authenticated)
5. After auth → Canvas opens automatically
6. Canvas appears in collaborator's dashboard
7. Both users see each other's cursors and changes in real-time

### Canvas Interaction Flow
1. Pan: Click and drag background
2. Zoom: Mouse wheel (zooms toward cursor)
3. Create shape: Click "Add Rectangle" → Click and drag on canvas
4. Move shape: Click to select → Drag to move
5. All changes sync instantly to other users on same canvas

## User Experience Goals

### Performance
- **60 FPS** during all interactions (pan, zoom, drag)
- **Sub-100ms** object sync latency
- **Sub-50ms** cursor sync latency
- No jank or stuttering with hundreds of shapes

### Visual Feedback
- Selected shapes: green border highlight
- Hover states: gray border on shapes
- Cursor colors: unique per user (owner=black, others=vibrant)
- Online users list: shows who's currently on this canvas
- Grid background: helps users orient in space, scales with zoom

### Reliability
- Auto-save to Firebase (no manual save)
- Graceful reconnection after network issues
- Optimistic updates (changes appear instantly, sync in background)
- Error handling with console warnings

### Simplicity
- Minimal UI chrome (focus on canvas)
- Clear toolbar with essential tools
- Dashboard grid layout for easy canvas browsing
- One-click sharing with copy-to-clipboard

## Success Metrics (MVP)

### Functional
- ✅ All authentication flows work
- ✅ Canvas creation and management functional
- ✅ Real-time sync verified with multiple browsers
- ✅ Multiplayer presence working (cursors + online list)
- ✅ Deployed to public URL

### Performance
- ✅ 60 FPS maintained during interactions
- ✅ 500+ shapes render without performance degradation
- ✅ Real-time latency meets targets (<100ms objects, <50ms cursors)

### User Validation
- Can 5+ users collaborate simultaneously on same canvas?
- Does the app feel responsive and smooth?
- Is canvas isolation working (no cross-contamination)?
- Can users easily create, share, and access canvases?

## Future Vision (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2 Possibilities
- AI agent integration for design assistance
- Additional shape types (circles, text, lines, polygons)
- Advanced transformations (rotation, resize handles)
- Permission levels (view-only, edit, admin)
- Canvas management (delete, rename, archive)
- Undo/redo with operational transforms
- Layer management and grouping
- Export to PNG/SVG
- Canvas templates and duplication
- Comments and annotations
- Mobile/tablet support
