```
Firebase Collections:
â”œâ”€â”€ /canvases/{canvasId} - Canvas metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ /canvas-objects/{canvasId}/objects/{objectId} - Shapes per canvas
â”œâ”€â”€ /user-canvases/{userId}/canvases/{canvasId} - User access tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ /presence/{canvasId}/users/{userId} - Online users per canvas
â”œâ”€â”€ /active-edits/{canvasId}/shapes/{shapeId} - Edit locks
â””â”€â”€ /users/{userId} - User profiles
```

### Key Patterns
- **Multi-canvas isolation** - Nested collections prevent cross-contamination
- **Optimistic updates** - Instant UI feedback with background sync
- **Real-time subscriptions** - Firebase onSnapshot for live updates
