## Known Issues & Tech Debt

### Issues to Address
1. **Security Rules** - Firestore in test mode; must deploy production rules before public launch
2. **Loading States** - Need spinners for dashboard and canvas loading (PR #9)
3. **Error UI** - Currently console.error only; need user-facing error messages (PR #9)
4. **Mobile Support** - Out of scope for MVP, but should handle gracefully (redirect or warning)
5. **Canvas Deletion** - Not implemented (out of scope for MVP, but users may request)

### Technical Debt
1. **No undo/redo** - Would require operational transforms or state history
2. **Basic conflict resolution** - Last-write-wins can cause overwrites
3. **No offline mode** - Requires network (Firebase has offline support, not prioritized)
4. **No optimistic rollback** - Failed writes just log errors
5. **No data compression** - Could optimize large canvases later
6. **No rate limiting** - Firebase has built-in limits, but not custom-tuned

### Performance Optimizations (Future)
- Canvas virtualization for 1000+ objects (if needed)
- Lazy loading for dashboard with many canvases
- Image/thumbnail caching for canvas cards
- WebSocket connection pooling (Firebase handles this)

## Notes & Observations

### What Went Well
- Test-driven approach caught many bugs early
- Multi-canvas architecture provides clean isolation
- Optimistic updates make app feel instant
- Grid optimization achieved 60 FPS
- Firebase real-time sync is reliable and fast

### Challenges Overcome
- Grid performance (solved with single draw call)
- Cursor zoom independence (solved with HTML overlay)
- Canvas isolation (solved with nested Firestore collections)
- Presence cleanup (solved with multiple event handlers)
- Test coverage for Canvas components (used unit tests instead of integration)

### Lessons Learned
- Start with performance in mind (grid optimization saved hours)
- Nested Firestore collections enable clean data isolation
- Throttling is critical for cursor updates (reduced Firebase writes 90%)
- HTML overlay for cursors better than Konva layer
- Optimistic updates greatly improve perceived performance
