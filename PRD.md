# CollabCanvas - Product Requirements Document

## Project Status: MVP Complete âœ… â†’ Phase 2 Active ðŸš€

Build a real-time collaborative canvas (Figma-like) where multiple users can simultaneously create, move, and manipulate shapes while seeing each other's cursors and changes in real-time.

**Phase 1 (MVP):** âœ… Complete - Core collaborative infrastructure proven  
**Phase 2 (Active):** Building advanced features and strengthening foundation  
**Timeline:** Quality and completeness over speed

**Architecture:** Multi-canvas architecture with project management. Users can create unlimited canvases, share them via links, and collaborate in real-time. Each canvas has its own isolated workspace with per-canvas presence and sync.

## Data Model

### Multi-Canvas Architecture
The application uses a multi-canvas data model with isolated workspaces:

**Canvases Collection:**
- Stores metadata for each canvas
- Document ID: unique canvas ID (used in URL `/canvas/:canvasId`)
- Fields:
  - `name`: Canvas title/name
  - `ownerId`: User ID of canvas creator
  - `ownerName`: Display name of owner
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp of creation
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp of last modification
  - `thumbnail`: (optional) Preview image URL

**Canvas Objects Collection:**
- Stores all objects for all canvases
- Document structure: `/canvas-objects/{canvasId}/objects/{objectId}`
- Each object has: `id`, `type` (rect/circle/text), `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `fill`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Objects are scoped per canvas for isolation

**User Canvas Access Collection:**
- Tracks which canvases each user has accessed (for dashboard display)
- Document structure: `/user-canvases/{userId}/canvases/{canvasId}`
- Fields: `canvasId`, `accessedAt`, `role` (owner or collaborator)
- Automatically created when user creates or accesses a canvas via link

**User Presence Collection:**
- Stores currently active users per canvas
- Document structure: `/presence/{canvasId}/users/{userId}`
- Fields: `userId`, `displayName`, `cursorX`, `cursorY`, `color`, `lastSeen`
- Automatically cleaned up on disconnect
- Isolated per canvas

**Users Collection:**
- User authentication data (managed by Firebase Auth)
- User profile data: `displayName`, `email`, `createdAt`

- Less control over data flow

**Alternative: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime)**
- Open-source, self-hostable
- More powerful queries (SQL)
- Better for complex data relationships
- Slightly more complex setup

**Alternative: Custom WebSocket Server (Node.js + Socket.io)**
- Maximum control and flexibility
- Better for custom conflict resolution
- More DevOps overhead
- Requires server management

### Deployment
**Recommendation: Vercel (Frontend) + Firebase (Backend/DB)**

**Why:**

## Previously Out of MVP Scope (Now Available)

### Previously Deferred (Now In Scope for Phase 2+):
- ðŸŽ¯ AI agent integration (future phase)
- ðŸš§ Deleting or archiving canvases (IN PROGRESS - Phase 2 Sprint 1)
- ðŸŽ¯ Renaming canvases after creation
- ðŸŽ¯ Removing collaborators from a canvas
- ðŸŽ¯ Permission levels (view-only vs edit access)
- ðŸŽ¯ Explicit list of who has access to a canvas
- ðŸŽ¯ Canvas templates or duplication
- ðŸŽ¯ Multiple shape types beyond rectangles (circles, text, lines - high priority)
- ðŸŽ¯ Advanced transformations (rotation, resize handles, skew)
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer management UI
- ðŸŽ¯ Undo/redo functionality (high priority)
- ðŸŽ¯ Copy/paste shapes
- ðŸŽ¯ Shape styling beyond basic colors (color picker, gradients, shadows)
- ðŸŽ¯ Keyboard shortcuts
- ðŸŽ¯ Export/import functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- ðŸŽ¯ Collaborative permissions (editor/viewer roles)
- ðŸŽ¯ Canvas versioning/history
- ðŸŽ¯ Comments or annotations
- ðŸŽ¯ Mobile optimization
- ðŸŽ¯ Operational transform for conflict resolution (advanced)

### Technical Debt Acceptable for MVP:
- Simple "last write wins" conflict resolution
- No optimistic UI updates (show after server confirms)
- No data compression for network efficiency
- Basic error handling (refresh to recover)
- Minimal input validation
- No performance monitoring/analytics

---

## Technical Pitfalls & Considerations

### Performance Risks
**Problem:** Canvas rendering can drop below 60 FPS with many objects
**Mitigation:** 
- Use Konva's layer caching
- Limit re-renders with React.memo
- Debounce cursor position updates
- Test with 500+ objects early

### Real-Time Sync Challenges
**Problem:** Race conditions when multiple users edit simultaneously
**Mitigation:**
- Document "last write wins" strategy clearly
- Use server timestamps for ordering
- Test with 2+ users editing the same object
- Consider object-level locking later (not MVP)

### Firebase Limitations
**Problem:** Firestore has limits on write frequency (1 write/second per document)
**Mitigation:**
- Use separate documents for cursors vs objects
- Batch cursor updates
- Consider Realtime Database instead of Firestore if hit limits

### State Synchronization Complexity
**Problem:** Keeping local state in sync with server state
**Mitigation:**
- Single source of truth (Firebase)
- Subscribe to changes immediately on mount
- Clear reconciliation strategy on reconnect

### Authentication Edge Cases
**Problem:** Anonymous users, session management
**Decision:** Authentication required before canvas access for MVP simplicity. No anonymous or guest access. All users must create an account and log in to access the global shared canvas.

## Open Questions & Design Decisions Needed

Before implementation begins, the following details need to be finalized:

### Shape Properties & Behavior
- **Which shape type** for MVP? (Rectangle, Circle, or Text)
- **Size customization:** Fixed size or user-adjustable?
- **Color customization:** Single default color or user-selectable?
- **Text-specific:** If text is chosen, can users edit content after creation? Default font size?

### Shape Creation Flow
- **Placement method:**
  - Option A: Click button â†’ shape appears at viewport center
  - Option B: Click button â†’ click canvas to place
  - Option C: Click button â†’ click and drag to create with custom size

### Data Persistence
- **Save timing:** When are changes written to Firebase?
  - On every mousemove during drag
  - On mouseup after drag completes
  - Debounced (e.g., every 100ms)

### Canvas Configuration
- **Canvas dimensions:** Actual pixel size (e.g., 10,000 x 10,000)?
- **Initial viewport position:** Where users start when first logging in (center, top-left, etc.)?
- **Cursor visibility:** Should users see their own cursor rendered (like others'), or only see other users' cursors?
