## Tasks

### Phase 1: Canvas Deletion (First Priority)

- [x] 1.0 **Implement Canvas Deletion Backend**
  - [x] 1.1 Open `src/services/canvas.service.ts` and add `deleteCanvas()` function
  - [x] 1.2 In `deleteCanvas()`, verify ownership: check if `canvas.ownerId === userId`, throw error if not owner
  - [x] 1.3 Delete canvas metadata: use `deleteDoc(doc(db, 'canvases', canvasId))`
  - [x] 1.4 Get all canvas objects: `getDocs(collection(db, 'canvas-objects', canvasId, 'objects'))`
  - [x] 1.5 Create Firestore batch: `writeBatch(db)` for deleting all objects
  - [x] 1.6 Loop through objects and add to batch: `batch.delete(objectDoc.ref)`
  - [x] 1.7 Commit batch deletion: `await batch.commit()`
  - [x] 1.8 Delete user access records (optional cleanup - can skip if complex)
  - [x] 1.9 Wrap everything in try-catch with helpful error messages
  - [x] 1.10 Add JSDoc comments explaining the function, params, and what it deletes

- [x] 2.0 **Create Canvas Deletion UI**
  - [x] 2.1 Open `src/components/dashboard/CanvasCard.tsx`
  - [x] 2.2 Add state: `const [showDeleteModal, setShowDeleteModal] = useState(false)`
  - [x] 2.3 Check if current user is owner: `const isOwner = canvas.ownerId === currentUser?.id`
  - [x] 2.4 Add delete button (only if isOwner): Button with trash icon, positioned top-right, visible on hover
  - [x] 2.5 Button onClick: `e.stopPropagation()` (prevent card click) and `setShowDeleteModal(true)`

  - [x] 2.9 Modal buttons: "Cancel" (gray) and "Delete" (red), disable both when isDeleting
  - [x] 2.10 Back in CanvasCard: Add `handleDelete` function that calls `deleteCanvas()` service
  - [x] 2.11 In handleDelete: Set loading state, try-catch, call `onDelete()` prop on success to refresh dashboard
  - [x] 2.12 Show success message after deletion (can use alert or console.log for now, toast in Phase 2)
  - [x] 2.13 Handle errors: show error message to user (alert or console.error for now)
