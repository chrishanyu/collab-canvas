- **Backend:** Vercel serverless function handles OpenAI communication
- **API Key:** Stored in `OPENAI_API_KEY` (server-side only, secure)
- **Modules:** All AI logic centralized in `/api/` folder:
  - `/api/ai-command.ts` - Main endpoint
  - `/api/lib/schemas.ts` - 15 tool definitions
  - `/api/lib/prompts.ts` - System prompts
  - `/api/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication
  - `/api/lib/rateLimit.ts` - Rate limiting
- **See:** `AI-ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed architecture decisions
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm run test` to run all tests
