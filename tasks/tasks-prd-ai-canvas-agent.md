## Task 4.0: Performance & Optimization - Partial Complete ✅

### Progress: 4/15 subtasks complete (Critical optimizations done)

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/canvasObjects.service.test.ts` - Batch write tests (9 tests, 330 lines)

  - 504 server timeout
  - Timeout setup verification

**Performance Impact:**
- **Grid Creation:** 10x10 grid now uses 1 batch write instead of 100 individual writes
- **Estimated Speedup:** ~50-100x faster for large grids (network latency elimination)
- **User Experience:** No hanging requests with 10-second timeout + clear feedback

**Test Summary:**
- **Batch write tests:** 9 passing
- **Timeout tests:** 3 passing (pre-existing)
