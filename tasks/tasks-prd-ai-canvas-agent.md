### Integration Tests
- `tests/integration/ai-commands.test.tsx` - End-to-end AI command execution tests

### Configuration
- `.env` - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (local development)
- `vercel.json` - Ensure AI API route is configured

### Notes

- **Architecture:** Secure serverless function with modular organization
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless function handles OpenAI communication
- **API Key:** Stored in `OPENAI_API_KEY` (server-side only, secure)
- **Modules:** Prompts, schemas, auth, rate limiting separated into `/api/lib/`
- **See:** `AI-ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed architecture decisions
- **See:** `CHECKPOINT-1-SETUP.md` for setup and testing instructions
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm run test` to run all tests
